    content: `I have been having a slowly growing burning feeling in the back of my head to do something for a while now, especially to help other immigrants learn Finnish and thrive in Finland. I think it started when I heard of the concept of reparenting oneself, i.e., providing for yourself the physical and emotional needs you wish you had as a child but didn't receive. In noticing the need for me to do that, I realized that even though I am 27 years old, I still feel like a child who has no idea what to do with all the incoming flow of decisions I need to make. I thought adults had all the answers, but nope, here I am in adulthood, still not knowing anything. A kid in an adult's body - I am sure a lot of you can relate.

Well, hold on a minute; does that mean my parents' shortcomings were for the same reason? They were living that episode of their life for the first time. Parenting me, parenting my siblings, living in a country where they didn‚Äôt understand Finnish, struggling with the same challenges many adult immigrants learning Finnish face today, buying a house, graduating from their master's, starting a business, attempting a PhD - all for the first time.

So I have been wanting to create things that would have helped my parents if I had been their friend when they were my age, having just moved to Finland. Something that would have enabled them not just to survive in Finland but to thrive in Finland. There were a few things I would want to do to help internationals living in Finland adjust better and succeed, such as providing language learning aids and education about real estate, among others. That is why I decided to create this limited language learning podcast series: **How I Learned Finnish - with Ohe**.

To be clear, this helps anyone learn a new language - not just Finnish. This podcast project aims to help **immigrants in Finland not only survive but also thrive** by improving their language skills. Through storytelling, it explores what it takes to achieve **adult fluency in one of the world's most difficult languages: Finnish**.

In 2022, I did something remarkable. I *pretended not to speak English for an entire year* to immerse myself in Finnish and learn Finnish fast as an adult immigrant, eventually reaching high-level fluency.

On January 1st, I publicly announced on LinkedIn and my social media that I would only speak Finnish with Finnish speakers from that point forward. What followed was an intense and mentally demanding immersion journey.

Now, through the podcast *How I Learned Finnish - with Ohe*, I share exactly what I did during that year to learn the language fluently. But more importantly, I seek out and interview others who have also successfully learned Finnish as adults, many reaching at least C-level fluency on the CEFR scale.

These cases are rare: according to a Finnish language educator, only about **2% of immigrants in Finland reach this level of fluency**. My podcast documents their stories, strategies, and insights.

### üéØ The goal is threefold:

1. **Normalizing Finnish Fluency for Adult Immigrants**  
   By showcasing diverse individuals who have achieved high-level Finnish fluency, the podcast aims to show that it is possible, even for those learning later in life.

2. **Practical Guidance for Learning Finnish as an Adult**  
   I interview people from a variety of backgrounds and life situations (parents, workers, students, different relationship and parenting statuses, etc.) so that listeners can find someone whose journey mirrors their own. This ensures that the advice and inspiration are not only aspirational but also applicable.

3. **Different Methods to Learn Finnish Fast**  
   For the listener to pick and choose which methods work best for them and their lifestyle.

---

In addition to these interviews, I also explore the **daily habits, lifestyle changes, resources**, and **mindsets** that make successful language learning possible - especially for busy adults. Many people start learning a new language but use their limited time ineffectively, often due to a lack of guidance.

This language learning podcast aims to change that, by showing it‚Äôs possible to learn Finnish fast as an adult immigrant through immersion, daily habits, and shared success stories

---

I aim to have a total of **10‚Äì15 episodes**. It is essential for me that this body of work exists. Even if just five people, ten years from now, say this project helped them achieve their language goals, I will consider the mission accomplished.

    # Best Finnish Podcasts for Learning the Language (My 2022 Immersion Journey)

## How I Used Podcasts to Learn Finnish in One Year

On January 1st, 2022, I announced to the world, on LinkedIn, Instagram, and all my socials, that if anyone I knew spoke Finnish, our conversations would only be in Finnish. It was my New Year‚Äôs resolution.

This was a calculated move: to force myself to speak Finnish for an entire year so that, by the end of it, I‚Äôd feel much more comfortable with the language.

It was a brutally uncomfortable year in that aspect. Significant time was spent outside my comfort zone. But I also knew the discomfort was temporary, and if I pushed through, the payoff would last for the rest of my life.

To accelerate my progress, I threw myself into Finnish: reading books and articles, watching with Finnish subtitles, doing grammar exercises, and most importantly, listening to podcasts. Podcasts were one of the best ways I found to learn Finnish fast.

This article is about the podcasts that helped me most.

## Why Podcasts Are So Powerful

I once met a British-Pakistani doctor who spoke surprisingly good Finnish after living in Finland for only a few months. His secret? For the year before relocating, he listened to *FinnishPod101* on his commute every single day.

That story convinced me: podcasts would be essential for my own learning too. Now I make the ["How I Learned Finnish - with Ohe"](https://www.howilearnedfinnish.fi/) podcast. where I interiview people who have learned Finnish to a high level of fluency to show you how anyone in any life circumstance can also learn Finnish. I even have a filter that allows you to filter guests based on life circumstance (Parent, Student, having a Finnish speaking partner or not, with kids?, fast-paced etc)

## How to Start Listening (Even If You Don‚Äôt Understand)

At first, I barely understood anything. Most Finnish podcasts are subject-matter heavy and spoken fluently.

But here‚Äôs the trick: you don‚Äôt need to understand everything. Just listen, pick up words here and there, and let your brain adapt.

Balance harder shows with **selkouutiset** (easy Finnish news). Listen to 30‚Äì60 minutes of selkouutiset daily, and you‚Äôll notice progress fast. By month three, I was already making sense of more advanced podcasts and learning about Finnish culture along the way.

## My Recommended Finnish Podcasts

Here are the categories and podcasts that worked for me:

### Easy Finnish

* **Yle Selkouutiset** (news in beginner Finnish)
* **FinnishPod101**
  *Perfect for building a base.*

*Essential for building a strong base. You can find more by searching ‚Äúselkouutiset‚Äù or ‚Äúeasy Finnish podcasts.‚Äù*


### Personal Finance, Investing & Real Estate

* *Melkein kaikki rahasta*
* *Nordnet‚Äôs Rahapodi*
* *Ostan Asuntoja Podcast*
* *Mimmit Sijoittaa*
* *Rahamania*
* *Salkunrakentaja-podi*
* *Sijoituskaverit*
* *Taloudellinen mielenrauha*

*I wanted to understand both personal finance and how the world works so this was one of my favorite categories.*

### Technology & Science

* *Herrasmieshakkerit*
* *Tiedetrippi*
* *Tiedeykk√∂nen*


*I‚Äôve always been a bit of a nerd. My favorite subject in school was biology, so this category was both fun and fascinating.*


### Pop Culture (Music, Movies, Books)

* *Yle‚Äôs Kulttuuriykk√∂nen*
* *Kysy mit√§ vaan*

*Light and enjoyable. Great when I wanted input that wasn‚Äôt too demanding.*


### News & Politics

* *HS Visio*
* *Yle Politiikkaradio*

### Storytelling & Lifestyle

* *Kaverin puolesta kyselen*
* *Yle‚Äôs 12 diktaattoria*
* *Oots√§ Varma*

*Documentary-style and story-driven shows made learning more entertaining and immersive.*

### Sports

Search for your favorite sport (football, Formula 1, boxing, etc.) in Finnish podcast apps. That‚Äôs how I found mine.

---

## A Handy App Hack

I use **Castbox**, which lets you label subscribed podcasts. I created a label called *Finnish*, so whenever one show ended, the next Finnish podcast started automatically.

This small system kept me immersed without needing extra actions. Systems like this are game-changers they make doing a thing easier than not doing it because you don't have to think about it.

---

## A Newer Podcast Worth Trying

Recently I discovered the **Finnish with Eemeli** podcast. It‚Äôs spoken slowly and clearly, making it perfect for learners who want easier listening practice.

---

## Final Thoughts

Podcasts became one of the most powerful tools in my Finnish-learning journey. They gave me constant exposure, connected me with Finnish culture, and fit naturally into my daily routines.

If you‚Äôre learning Finnish, pick at least one podcast today and just start listening. The first weeks will feel hard, but your brain adapts quickly. Choose a subject you love, stick with it, and you‚Äôll be amazed at how far you can get.
