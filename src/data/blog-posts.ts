I think it started when I heard of the concept of reparenting oneself, i.e., providing for yourself the physical and emotional needs you wish you had as a child but didn't receive. In noticing the need for me to do that, I realized that even though I am 27 years old, I still feel like a child who has no idea what to do with all the incoming flow of decisions I need to make. I thought adults had all the answers, but nope, here I am in adulthood, still not knowing anything. A kid in an adult's body - I am sure a lot of you can relate.

Well, hold on a minute; does that mean my parents' shortcomings were for the same reason? They were living that episode of their life for the first time. Parenting me, parenting my siblings, living in a country where they don't understand the language, buying a house, graduating from their master's, starting a business, attempting a PhD - all for the first time.

So I have been wanting to create things that would have helped my parents if I had been their friend when they were my age, having just moved to Finland. Something that would have enabled them not just to survive in Finland but to thrive in Finland. There were a few things I would want to do to help internationals living in Finland adjust better and succeed, such as providing language learning aids and education about real estate, among others. That is why I decided to create this limited podcast series: **How I Learned Finnish - with Ohe**.

To be clear, this helps anyone learn a new language - not just Finnish. This podcast project aims to help **immigrants in Finland not only survive but also thrive** by improving their language skills. Through storytelling, it explores what it takes to achieve **adult fluency in one of the world's most difficult languages: Finnish**.

In 2022, I did something remarkable. I **pretended not to speak English for an entire year** to immerse myself in Finnish and achieve high-level fluency as an adult.

On January 1st, I publicly announced on LinkedIn and my social media that I would only speak Finnish with Finnish speakers from that point forward. What followed was an intense and mentally demanding immersion journey.

Now, through the podcast *How I Learned Finnish - with Ohe*, I share exactly what I did during that year to learn the language fluently. But more importantly, I seek out and interview others who have also successfully learned Finnish as adults - people who have reached at least a **C level on the CEFR scale**.

These cases are rare: according to a Finnish language educator, only about **2% of immigrants in Finland reach this level of fluency**. My podcast documents their stories, strategies, and insights.

### üéØ The goal is threefold:

1. **To normalize fluency for adult learners**  
   By showcasing diverse individuals who have achieved high-level Finnish fluency, the podcast aims to show that it is possible, even for those learning later in life.

2. **To provide practical, relatable guidance**  
   I interview people from a variety of backgrounds and life situations (parents, workers, students, different relationship and parenting statuses, etc.) so that listeners can find someone whose journey mirrors their own. This ensures that the advice and inspiration are not only aspirational but also applicable.

3. **To show many different methods of improving**  
   For the listener to pick and choose which methods work best for them and their lifestyle.

---

In addition to these interviews, I also explore the **daily habits, lifestyle changes, resources**, and **mindsets** that make successful language learning possible - especially for busy adults. Many people start learning a new language but use their limited time ineffectively, often due to a lack of guidance.

This podcast aims to change that.

---

I aim to have a total of **10‚Äì15 episodes**. It is essential for me that this body of work exists. Even if just five people, ten years from now, say this project helped them achieve their language goals, I will consider the mission accomplished.

# 5 Daily Habits That Transformed My Finnish Learning

After interviewing dozens of successful Finnish learners, I've identified the five daily habits that make the biggest difference in achieving fluency. These aren't just study tips - they're lifestyle changes that create lasting results.

## 1. Morning Finnish Ritual (15 minutes)

Start every day with Finnish input. This could be:

- **News in Finnish** - Yle Uutiset or HS
- **Finnish podcast** - Even if you only understand 20%
- **Finnish music** - Listen while getting ready
- **Finnish social media** - Follow Finnish accounts

### Why This Works

Your brain is most receptive to new information in the morning. Starting with Finnish primes your brain for the language throughout the day.

## 2. Active Listening Practice (30 minutes)

This is different from passive listening. Active listening means:

- **Focusing completely** on the audio
- **Trying to understand** every word
- **Repeating phrases** you hear
- **Taking notes** on new vocabulary

### My Favorite Resources

- **Yle Areena** - Finnish TV shows and documentaries
- **Finnish radio** - Yle Radio 1 or Radio Suomi
- **Podcasts** - Opetellaan suomea or other Finnish learning podcasts

## 3. Speaking Practice (20 minutes daily)

Even if you're alone, practice speaking:

- **Talk to yourself** in Finnish
- **Describe your day** out loud
- **Practice common conversations**
- **Record yourself** and listen back

### Speaking Practice Ideas

- Order coffee in Finnish
- Ask for directions (even if you know where you're going)
- Make small talk with cashiers
- Join Finnish conversation groups

## 4. Vocabulary Building (10 minutes)

Focus on high-frequency words:

- **Learn 5-10 new words** per day
- **Review previous words** using spaced repetition
- **Use words in context** - don't just memorize definitions
- **Create personal connections** to remember better

### Effective Vocabulary Strategies

- **Word families** - Learn related words together
- **Personal examples** - Connect words to your life
- **Visual associations** - Create mental images
- **Regular review** - Use apps like Anki or Quizlet

## 5. Evening Reflection (5 minutes)

End your day by reflecting on your Finnish learning:

- **What did you learn today?**
- **What was challenging?**
- **What went well?**
- **What will you do differently tomorrow?**

### Reflection Questions

- Did I use Finnish today?
- What new words did I encounter?
- What conversations did I have?
- How can I improve tomorrow?

## The Power of Consistency

The key isn't doing these habits perfectly - it's doing them consistently. Even 10 minutes of focused practice every day is better than 2 hours once a week.

## Tracking Your Progress

Keep a simple log of your daily habits:

- ‚úÖ Morning ritual
- ‚úÖ Active listening
- ‚úÖ Speaking practice
- ‚úÖ Vocabulary building
- ‚úÖ Evening reflection

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Trying to do too much** - Start small and build up
2. **Focusing only on grammar** - Communication is more important
3. **Avoiding mistakes** - They're part of the learning process
4. **Comparing yourself to others** - Everyone learns at their own pace

## The Results

After implementing these habits for 6 months:

- **Listening comprehension** improved by 60%
- **Speaking confidence** increased dramatically
- **Vocabulary retention** was much better
- **Overall fluency** progressed faster than expected

## Start Today

Don't wait for the perfect time to start. Begin with just one habit and add more as you build momentum. Remember, consistency beats perfection every time.
