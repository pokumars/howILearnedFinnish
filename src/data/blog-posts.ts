If I were asked how I would describe the Finnish language, I would say it is *sui generis*.  
*Sui generis* is a Latin phrase I learned in law school which means "a kind of its own." Finnish is indeed distinct—its origins and structure differ significantly from its neighboring Indo-European languages. It belongs to the Proto-Finnic branch of the broader Proto-Uralic language family.  

All this is to say: the learning journey is not necessarily easy. But with the right mindset and determination, it can be done.  

In this short article, I aim to recount my own learning experience to humanize the journey, to list the references I used, and to share the advice I would give myself at each stage. For clarity, I will divide this account according to the CEFR levels of language proficiency (A1–C2).

## A1–A2

Under the Finnish government's Integration Program, I began learning Finnish at an educational institution that assessed my skills and placed me in a group suited to my level.  

Unlike many language courses, Finnish was taught in context. As adult learners, we studied grammar—cases, verbs, nouns, and so on—through practical, everyday situations relevant to immigrants. For instance, we learned grammar in the context of a doctor's appointment, a trip to the market, and other daily tasks. This contextual approach was highly effective; learning is always easier when it is connected to lived experience.  

Realistically, at this level, one cannot yet hold a proper conversation. It is about laying foundations: through imitation and memorization. I imitated my teachers' speech, copied Finns' pronunciation, and memorized greetings and common phrases.  

My classmates thought I was more advanced because I could exchange words with them and my teacher, but in truth, I was not yet able to do the same with a native Finn.  

The references and books I used at this stage (with comments) are as follows:  

1. **Ahaa! 1**  
   This book was okay, but I find the next book *Suomen Mestari* more comprehensive, contextual, and well-written.  

2. **Suomen Mestari 1**  
   This is one of the most well-known, if not the most, grammar books used by immigrants, whether or not they are in the integration program or doing self-study.  

3. **Suomi-englanti sanakirja**  
   Needless to say, a good dictionary is always a must in studying Finnish or any language, for that matter.  

4. **Children's comics like Akku Ankka**  
   I did not really go through a lot of these, but in the next levels of language learning, I realized that if I wanted to get more acquainted with *puhekieli*, I should have read this more.  

5. **Children's shows like Muummilakson tarinoita**  
   These shows were fun, although at this stage, there are lots of words and phrases that still went over my head.  

6. **Children's songs like Jumppalaulu**  
   I remember our teacher asked us to sing this while acting it out. Well, it was quite memorable together with the other songs about the Finnish season, alphabet, etc. But as an adult, it felt really embarrassing. So, you can sing and play these children's songs privately instead.  

If I could advise myself at this stage, I would say:  
> "Do not overthink everything. Take it one step at a time: one grammar point, one phrase, one task at a time. Comparing grammar rules is fine, but do not delve too much into the differences distinct to the Finnish language."  

---

## A2–B1

Before finishing my first course, I became pregnant with my son. Still, I managed almost a year of studies, including a month-long language internship at a small Finnish law firm in Lahti. My evaluation placed me at B1 in speaking and writing, and A2.2 in listening and comprehension.  

Because I was due soon, I decided not to continue to the next course level. After giving birth, I took six months of maternity leave, then enrolled in an online open university course while caring for my baby.  

Even without a formal course, I continued learning, albeit more passively. At this stage, grammar remained challenging. The partitive case, a concept absent in both English and my native language, was particularly perplexing. I was also frustrated by the differences between spoken and written Finnish; it felt like learning two languages at once.  

Progress was not always visible. Conversations with natives were still frustrating, though my comprehension had improved compared to the first stage.  

Some of the prior mentioned references are still in use at this stage, especially the dictionary, but here are some specific references and books I used at this stage:  

1. **Finnish Christian hymns and verses:**  
   I am well acquainted with Christian hymns and songs, so singing them (not always with full understanding) is not as cumbersome as studying grammar, since singing is one of my hobbies.  

2. **The Finnish Bible:**  
   This one was quite tough and still is. The Finnish Bible is also composed of words and phrases that are no longer in use, so some of them won't necessarily be found in modern and common Finnish literature. However, since this book is most important to me, I'd like to be able to fully read it through as I do in English and Tagalog.  

3. **Suomen Mestari 2**  

4. **From Start to Finnish by Leila White:**  
   This is my favorite grammar book, obviously, because I am an English speaker. Making sense of the Finnish grammar, as explained or even compared in English, was so useful for me.  

5. **Glosbe and Redfox Dictionaries:**  
   Even though not all of the words can be found through these platforms, I like that they offer examples for the words being searched.  

Looking back, I would tell myself:  
> "Be kind to yourself. You are raising a child while adjusting to so many changes in life. Finnish is not everything. Celebrate small victories—the little concepts you understood, the phrases you managed to use, the idioms you jotted down in your notebook."  

---

## B1–B2

In my second year of learning, I decided to take the YKI Intermediate Test (which assesses at B1–B2). Unsure if I was ready, I enrolled in an intensive B1–B2 course online.  

This course was both challenging and rewarding. The fast pace suited me, and my classmates—many of whom had lived in Finland far longer than I had—pushed me to improve. It was intimidating, but necessary. I needed a teacher who could explain nuances and classmates whose fluency inspired me. It became a fruitful learning curve.  

When the YKI exam came, I found the speaking section most difficult. The test setting was less than ideal—we had to listen to recordings and respond while others around us spoke simultaneously. Even so, I focused on my own test, did my best, and applied what I had learned.  

Months later, I received the results: B1 in writing and listening, B2 in speaking and comprehension. I was satisfied. I had achieved the goal I had set for myself.  

Some of the prior mentioned references are still in use at this stage, especially the dictionaries, but here are some specific references and books I used at this stage:  

1. **Gimara YT channel**  
   I was just looking for some videos on YouTube that can help with listening and understanding, and this channel popped out. It was helpful, although I was not able to go through every one of them because of time constraints.  

2. **Suomen Mestari 3 and 4**  

3. **Lotta from Finished**  
   As I was scrolling through my Facebook, my algorithm must have directed me to such sort of pages and promotions. She is a multi-lingual Finnish native who promotes understanding and listening as the main avenue for learning Finnish and not grammar learning especially for beginners. I bought a subscription (this is not promotional) because I was curious about the claims made, and the materials turned out to be useful to a certain extent, although, up to date, I have not finished them all. And also, I am a firm believer in studying grammar as essential as other methods.  

My advice to that version of me:  
> "You do not need to meet everyone's expectations. Learn at your own pace. Leverage your strengths, improve your weaknesses. In listening, focus on the 80% you understood and let go of the 20% you did not. The essence is what matters."  

---

## B2–C1

In my third year of Finnish studies, I realized that if I wanted to work in my profession, I needed to reach C1–C2. This was non-negotiable. Law is not about personal interest—it is about life, liberty, property, and society. From the moment I took my oath as an attorney-at-law in my home country, I knew that being a lawyer is always larger than oneself.  

With this conviction, I decided to challenge myself by studying the Finnish legal system in Finnish. It was uncomfortable, but I knew that discomfort would lead to growth. For me, these goals, though perhaps unrealistic for some immigrants, were a necessary reality.  

I applied to the Master of Laws (OTM) program at the University of Helsinki. To demonstrate my language skills, I took the *Valtionhallinnon kielitutkinto (VKT)*, the Civil Service Language Proficiency Test. Thankfully, I passed at *hyvä taso* (B2–C1). Compared with YKI, I found the VKT harder for it demanded fluency in societal issues, workplace communication, and abstract discussion. The one-on-one format with the examiner required a level of precision and nuance far beyond everyday interaction.  

A few months later, I received my admission letter: I was accepted into the Master of Laws program at the University of Helsinki. The next stage of my Finnish journey had begun.  

Some of the prior mentioned references are still in use at this stage, especially the dictionaries, but here are some specific references, courses, and tools I used at this stage:  

1. **Valmentava koulutus korkeakouluopintoihin maahanmuuttajille at LAB University:**  
   I applied to this six-month course in order to be acquainted with how university life works, such as tasks, assignments, and lectures in Finnish. Although every university may be different in its system and mode of instruction, I find the tasks here, such as article writing, reporting, and reading academic writing in one's own profession, were really beneficial.  

2. **Artificial Intelligence Apps such as ChatGPT:**  
   During my preparation for the VKT, I have had lots of questions regarding construction, spoken Finnish, grammar, expressions, and legal phrases and terms. Many of these may not be answered by a teacher, but AI was able to. Although there are some sort of glitches here and there, I find AI as my language companion for the latter part of my studies.  

3. **Podcasts:**  
   I listen to podcasts specifically related to my profession. Some of them are *Pääkäsittely*, *Juristipodi*, *Päätös*, etc. These are interviews of lawyers, thought leaders, and experts on their respective fields of specialization. Through this, I learned a lot of mixed spoken and formal Finnish, technical terms, nuanced concepts, and so on.  

To myself at this stage, I would say:  
> "You have worked hard, and your efforts have borne fruit. You are not yet at your ultimate goal, but you will get there. Remember: faith, family, and well-being matter more than Finnish. By grace, all will fall into place."  

---

## C1–C2

This is the level I still aspire to—and one that, according to linguists, may take a lifetime. And that is completely fine. Finnish is unique, challenging, and beautiful.  

So I end with this: to myself now, and to anyone learning Finnish at any level, a quote from Harvard Law School,  

> "You are ready to aid in the shaping and application of those wise restraints that make men free."  

I am convinced that at the height of this journey lies freedom, not from discipline, but through it. Freedom from the struggles of learning Finnish, or any language, comes only through the wise restraints we willingly set for ourselves.`,

    # Best Finnish Podcasts for Learning the Language (My 2022 Immersion Journey)

## How I Used Podcasts to Learn Finnish in One Year

On January 1st, 2022, I announced to the world, on LinkedIn, Instagram, and all my socials, that if anyone I knew spoke Finnish, our conversations would only be in Finnish. It was my New Year’s resolution.

This was a calculated move: to force myself to speak Finnish for an entire year so that, by the end of it, I’d feel much more comfortable with the language.

It was a brutally uncomfortable year in that aspect. Significant time was spent outside my comfort zone. But I also knew the discomfort was temporary, and if I pushed through, the payoff would last for the rest of my life.

To accelerate my progress, I threw myself into Finnish: reading books and articles, watching with Finnish subtitles, doing grammar exercises, and most importantly, listening to podcasts. Podcasts were one of the best ways I found to learn Finnish fast.

This article is about the podcasts that helped me most.

---

## Why Podcasts Are So Powerful

I once met a British-Pakistani doctor who spoke surprisingly good Finnish after living in Finland for only a few months. His secret? For the year before relocating, he listened to *FinnishPod101* on his commute every single day.

That story convinced me: podcasts would be essential for my own learning too. Now I make the ["How I Learned Finnish - with Ohe"](https://www.howilearnedfinnish.fi/) podcast. where I interiview people who have learned Finnish to a high level of fluency to show you how anyone in any life circumstance can also learn Finnish. I even have a filter that allows you to filter guests based on life circumstance (Parent, Student, having a Finnish speaking partner or not, with kids?, fast-paced etc)

---

## How to Start Listening (Even If You Don’t Understand)

At first, I barely understood anything. Most Finnish podcasts are subject-matter heavy and spoken fluently.

But here’s the trick: you don’t need to understand everything. Just listen, pick up words here and there, and let your brain adapt.

Balance harder shows with **selkouutiset** (easy Finnish news). Listen to 30–60 minutes of selkouutiset daily, and you’ll notice progress fast. By month three, I was already making sense of more advanced podcasts and learning about Finnish culture along the way.

---

## My Recommended Finnish Podcasts

Here are the categories and podcasts that worked for me:

### Easy Finnish

* **Yle Selkouutiset** (news in beginner Finnish)
* **FinnishPod101**
  *Perfect for building a base.*

*Essential for building a strong base. You can find more by searching “selkouutiset” or “easy Finnish podcasts.”*


### Personal Finance, Investing & Real Estate

* *Melkein kaikki rahasta*
* *Nordnet’s Rahapodi*
* *Ostan Asuntoja Podcast*
* *Mimmit Sijoittaa*
* *Rahamania*
* *Salkunrakentaja-podi*
* *Sijoituskaverit*
* *Taloudellinen mielenrauha*

*I wanted to understand both personal finance and how the world works so this was one of my favorite categories.*

### Technology & Science

* *Herrasmieshakkerit*
* *Tiedetrippi*
* *Tiedeykkönen*


*I’ve always been a bit of a nerd. My favorite subject in school was biology, so this category was both fun and fascinating.*


### Pop Culture (Music, Movies, Books)

* *Yle’s Kulttuuriykkönen*
* *Kysy mitä vaan*

*Light and enjoyable. Great when I wanted input that wasn’t too demanding.*


### News & Politics

* *HS Visio*
* *Yle Politiikkaradio*

### Storytelling & Lifestyle

* *Kaverin puolesta kyselen*
* *Yle’s 12 diktaattoria*
* *Ootsä Varma*

*Documentary-style and story-driven shows made learning more entertaining and immersive.*

### Sports

Search for your favorite sport (football, Formula 1, boxing, etc.) in Finnish podcast apps. That’s how I found mine.

---

## A Handy App Hack

I use **Castbox**, which lets you label subscribed podcasts. I created a label called *Finnish*, so whenever one show ended, the next Finnish podcast started automatically.

This small system kept me immersed without needing extra actions. Systems like this are game-changers they make doing a thing easier than not doing it because you don't have to think about it.

---

## A Newer Podcast Worth Trying

Recently I discovered the **Finnish with Eemeli** podcast. It’s spoken slowly and clearly, making it perfect for learners who want easier listening practice.

---

## Final Thoughts

Podcasts became one of the most powerful tools in my Finnish-learning journey. They gave me constant exposure, connected me with Finnish culture, and fit naturally into my daily routines.

If you’re learning Finnish, pick at least one podcast today and just start listening. The first weeks will feel hard, but your brain adapts quickly. Choose a subject you love, stick with it, and you’ll be amazed at how far you can get.

    content: `I have been having a slowly growing burning feeling in the back of my head to do something for a while now, especially to help other immigrants learn Finnish and thrive in Finland. I think it started when I heard of the concept of reparenting oneself, i.e., providing for yourself the physical and emotional needs you wish you had as a child but didn't receive. In noticing the need for me to do that, I realized that even though I am 27 years old, I still feel like a child who has no idea what to do with all the incoming flow of decisions I need to make. I thought adults had all the answers, but nope, here I am in adulthood, still not knowing anything. A kid in an adult's body - I am sure a lot of you can relate.

Well, hold on a minute; does that mean my parents' shortcomings were for the same reason? They were living that episode of their life for the first time. Parenting me, parenting my siblings, living in a country where they didn’t understand Finnish, struggling with the same challenges many adult immigrants learning Finnish face today, buying a house, graduating from their master's, starting a business, attempting a PhD - all for the first time.

So I have been wanting to create things that would have helped my parents if I had been their friend when they were my age, having just moved to Finland. Something that would have enabled them not just to survive in Finland but to thrive in Finland. There were a few things I would want to do to help internationals living in Finland adjust better and succeed, such as providing language learning aids and education about real estate, among others. That is why I decided to create this limited language learning podcast series: **How I Learned Finnish - with Ohe**.

To be clear, this helps anyone learn a new language - not just Finnish. This podcast project aims to help **immigrants in Finland not only survive but also thrive** by improving their language skills. Through storytelling, it explores what it takes to achieve **adult fluency in one of the world's most difficult languages: Finnish**.

🎧 **Listen/Watch** "How I Learned Finnish - with Ohe" via this link: [https://www.howilearnedfinnish.fi](https://www.howilearnedfinnish.fi)

In 2022, I did something remarkable. I *pretended not to speak English for an entire year* to immerse myself in Finnish and learn Finnish fast as an adult immigrant, eventually reaching high-level fluency.

On January 1st, I publicly announced on LinkedIn and my social media that I would only speak Finnish with Finnish speakers from that point forward. What followed was an intense and mentally demanding immersion journey.

Now, through the podcast *How I Learned Finnish - with Ohe*, I share exactly what I did during that year to learn the language fluently. But more importantly, I seek out and interview others who have also successfully learned Finnish as adults, many reaching at least C-level fluency on the CEFR scale.

These cases are rare: according to a Finnish language educator, only about **2% of immigrants in Finland reach this level of fluency**. My podcast documents their stories, strategies, and insights.

---

### 🎯 The goal is threefold:

1. **Normalizing Finnish Fluency for Adult Immigrants**  
   By showcasing diverse individuals who have achieved high-level Finnish fluency, the podcast aims to show that it is possible, even for those learning later in life.

2. **Practical Guidance for Learning Finnish as an Adult**  
   I interview people from a variety of backgrounds and life situations (parents, workers, students, different relationship and parenting statuses, etc.) so that listeners can find someone whose journey mirrors their own. This ensures that the advice and inspiration are not only aspirational but also applicable.

3. **Different Methods to Learn Finnish Fast**  
   For the listener to pick and choose which methods work best for them and their lifestyle.

---

In addition to these interviews, I also explore the **daily habits, lifestyle changes, resources**, and **mindsets** that make successful language learning possible - especially for busy adults. Many people start learning a new language but use their limited time ineffectively, often due to a lack of guidance.

This language learning podcast aims to change that, by showing it’s possible to learn Finnish fast as an adult immigrant through immersion, daily habits, and shared success stories

---

I aim to have a total of **10–15 episodes**. It is essential for me that this body of work exists. Even if just five people, ten years from now, say this project helped them achieve their language goals, I will consider the mission accomplished.
